The MPI-3.1 Standard defines three methods of Fortran support.
An MPI program can be written using one of these.

- ``USE mpi_f08``
- ``USE mpi``
- ``INCLUDE 'mpif.h'``

Additionally, Open MPI can provide MPI extensions (mpiext).
MPI extensions are routines that are not defined in MPI Standard
but defined by the Open MPI community, and are available
only if Open MPI is configured to include MPI extensions via
the ``--enable-mpi-ext`` option of the ``configure`` script.
MPI extensions also can be used from an MPI program through
one of three methods.

- ``USE mpi_f08_ext``
- ``USE mpi_ext``
- ``INCLUDE 'mpif-ext.h'``

For these methods the build procedure of Open MPI generates
following include files and modules.
Modules are compiler-dependent files and typically named ``*.mod``
(``mpi.mod`` for the ``mpi`` module).

- ``mpi_f08`` module
- ``mpi`` module
- ``mpif.h`` file
- ``mpi_f08_ext`` module
- ``mpi_ext`` module
- ``mpif-ext.h`` file

These files are generated from other source files and *include*
or *use* other include files and modules. So the relation is
complex.

I created a graph which describes the dependencies of source files
and generated files.

Yellow boxes are source files. Green boxes are generated files.
Blue boxes are files created by users.
``USE mpi`` support of Open MPI is built from either
``ompi/mpi/fortran/use-mpi-ignore-tkr`` directory or
``ompi/mpi/fortran/use-mpi-tkr`` directory.
The former can provide better Fortran-MPI integration
but requires some compiler extension.
My graph assumes to use ``ompi/mpi/fortran/use-mpi-ignore-tkr``.
