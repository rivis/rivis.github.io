<!-- style: docutils-report -->
      <p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://www.open-mpi.org/">Open MPI</a>, the <strong>PML</strong> framework
has charge of point-to-point communications.
<strong>ob1</strong> is one of components in the PML framework which executes
communications utilizing <strong>BTL</strong> component(s).</p>
      <p>The ob1 PML implements some communication protocols and selects
a protocol for a point-to-point communication based on several
conditions such as the messeage to send and underlying BTL
component(s).</p>
      <p>This document describes the communication protocols and
their procedures in the ob1 PML as of Open MPI 2.1.</p>

        <p>Protocols implemented in the ob1 PML is broadly categorized as
<strong>eager protocol</strong> and <strong>rendezvous protocol</strong>.</p>
        <p>There is only one protocol in the eager protocol: <strong>Eager Send</strong>.
The ob1 PML has three implementations for Eager Send.
Though they are same in communication protocol level,
I describe them separately in this document.</p>

          <li>
            <strong>Eager Send (Allocated)</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are several protocols in the rendezvous protocol.</p>

        <h1>
          <a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Protocol Selection</a>
        </h1>
        <p>Some protocols cannot be used for non-contiguous buffer.
Some protocols cannot be used on certain BTL components.
Specific types of protocols must be used for a given communication
mode (defined in the MPI Standard: standard, bufferd, synchronous,
and ready).
The fastest protocol varies based on a message size.
So a protocol to use is selected per message.
Furthermore, a protocol cannot be determined only on a sending
process nor on a receiving process because datatypes passed
to the <tt class="docutils literal">MPI_SEND</tt> and the <tt class="docutils literal">MPI_RECV</tt> may not be equivalent.</p>
        <p>A candidate protocol is selected on a sending process and
the information is sent to a receiving process.
Once the receiving process receives the information,
the receiving process check whether the protocol is
acceptable and determine a final protocol.</p>
        <p>The selection procedure on a sending process is described below.</p>

Each fragment is transfered in the send/receive semantics.
